-Arda's Macro Pad;

Hello. I am Arda this is my project a custom Macro Pad.

-Project Folders
I organized everything into folders to keep it clean, as requested:

PCB: You can find my KiCad files here (schematic and board layout). I also added a PDF of the schematic if you don't have KiCad installed.
CAD: This folder has the 3D models for the case and the top plate. I'm planning to 3D print these.
Images: I've uploaded screenshots of my PCB, the schematic, and some 3D renders so you can see the final look.
Firmware: My `code.py` file is in this folder.

-Components I Used
Seeed Studio XIAO
Mechanical Switches
3D Printed Case (Top and Bottom)

I've updated everything based on the feedback. Hope it looks good now.
