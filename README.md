# Arda's Macropad 

This project is a custom-designed mechanical macro pad. It includes the complete PCB design, 3D printable enclosure, and technical documentation.

##  Project Files & Descriptions

### 🔧 Design Files (KiCad)
* **arda.kicad_pro**: The main project management file that links all design elements.
* **arda.kicad_sch**: The electrical schematic showing how the XIAO MCU and switches are connected.
* **arda.kicad_pcb**: The physical board layout including copper traces and component placements.
* **arda.pdf**: A portable version of the schematic for quick viewing.

###  3D Modeling (Enclosure)
* **Case.step**: The 3D model for the bottom part of the macro pad enclosure.
* **Top.step**: The 3D model for the top plate where the switches are mounted.

###  Visual Renders (Assembly)
* **pcb front.png & pcb back.png**: High-resolution renders showing the PCB traces and "XIAO HERE!" labeling.
* **Case3d.png & top3d.png**: 3D visualizations of the fully assembled case and component housing.
